  <h1>Ethics Statement</h1>
  <p>This website is run by the QUT Ecoacoustics Research Group.</p>

  <p>
    If you are using this website to participate in a research student’s study,
    please refer to the ethics statement that was previously distributed to you.
    If you have not received an ethics statement from a research student, you
    should contact the
    <a href="http://www.orei.qut.edu.au/index.jsp"
      >QUT Office of Research Ethics and Integrity</a
    >
  </p>

  <h2>Principal Researcher</h2>

  <p>The principal researcher for this project is Professor Paul Roe (QUT).</p>

  <h2>Participation</h2>

  <p>
    Your participation in this project is entirely voluntary. If you do agree to
    participate, you can withdraw from the project without comment or penalty.
    Personally identifiable information already obtained from you will be
    <strong>NOT</strong> destroyed. However, all contributed data will be
    anonymous to other users. Your decision to participate (or not), will in no
    way impact upon your current or future relationship with QUT.
  </p>

  <p>
    To participate create an account on the website. You can cease participation
    by deactivating your account on the website. When your account is
    deactivated, you can no longer log in, or make any changes. No other user
    will be able to see your identifiable information. Other contributions you
    may have made, such as adding annotations or tags, will be made anonymous
    and kept.
  </p>

  <p>
    Participation will involve interaction with several web pages. You can
    choose to stop participating at any time. The tasks will include activities
    like listening to audio on a web page, annotating that audio, and applying
    classification tags. Your participation in this project may involve
    interaction with content created by other participants on the website. This
    would occur by viewing the history of another participant’s activity on the
    website, annotating data, or as part of a list of suggested tags. The
    website may include competitive elements, such as a display of participants
    ranked by the amount of work each has completed up to that point in time.
  </p>

  <h2>Expected Benefits</h2>

  <p>
    The goal of this project is to host, manage, and analyse environmental
    acoustic data. This project aims to benefit environmental research,
    particularly research into ecoacoustics. This can include studies of changes
    in particular environmental regions and evaluations of proposed development
    works on the environment. In this way, any participation on your behalf will
    go towards understanding the environment. Your participation may benefit you
    and other website users through the annotation, hosting, analysis, or
    visualisation of audio data.
  </p>

  <p>
    This website will not provide any financial benefit, any warranty on data,
    or any commitment to continued service.
  </p>

  <h2>Privacy and Confidentiality</h2>

  <p>
    All comments, responses, and personally identifiable user contributed data
    will be treated confidentially. The actions that you perform to complete
    tasks on the website may be monitored, such as the buttons you click and the
    identifier of the recorded audio that is loaded. The monitoring is only for
    evaluating and improving the website, and will only be available to the
    research team.
  </p>

  <p>
    Any data collected as part of this project will be stored securely as per
    QUT’s management of research data policy.
  </p>

  <p>
    Please note that non-identifiable data collected in this project may be used
    as comparative data in future projects.
  </p>

  <p>
    If you are involved in a discovery or some other notable event, we may ask
    you for permission to publicly use your user name, real name, or both. This
    is entirely optional.
  </p>

  <p>
    If you fill out the <em>first name</em> and <em>surname</em> fields in the
    user profile, then your name may be used in automatically generated
    citations for audio data, annotation data, or other generated data sets that
    may include users in their citations.
  </p>

  <h2>Social aspects of the website</h2>

  <p>
