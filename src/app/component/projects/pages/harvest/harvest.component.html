      <h3>Basic Details</h3>

      <p>
        Harvesting is the name we use for the process of uploading/ingesting
        large amounts of audio data (e.g 3TB, or 4000 files at a time) into our
        website. For our users, this allows you to submit your recorded
        environment audio for analysis and view the results directly through the
        website. Currently harvesting performs several actions such as:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          Converting audio files to formats compatible with our website
        </li>
        <li>
          Basic integrity checks on the data harvested
        </li>
        <li>
          Gathering metadata about the audio (format, channels, bitrate, sample
          rate, duration, etc.)
        </li>
        <li>
          Assigning audio to sites and projects
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        If you wish to upload your recorded audio data, press the button at the
        bottom right which will guide you through the process. Please be aware
        that this will take a long time to complete, however you are not
        required to perform it all in one sitting. If you leave this page and
        come back, it will automatically detect what stage of harvesting you
        were at.
      </p>

    <!-- User credentials for accessing SFTP -->
    <div *ngSwitchCase="steps.credentials">
      <h3>Credentials</h3>

      <p>
        The initial step to harvesting is to upload your audio data to our
        server. The credentials you can see below are generated with one-time
        details that will expire after [INSERT] hours. Please keep track of the
        username, password, and URI until you have finished your upload. To
        access the server, open the URI link in a new tab/window and enter your
        credentials (username/password) when prompted. The file structure you
        use is very important when you upload, and we ask you follow the
        following format:
      </p>

      <pre>
/{{ "{" }}project{{ "}" }}/{{ "{" }}deployment{{ "}" }}/{{ "{" }}site{{
          "}"
        }}/[{{ "{" }}memory_card{{ "}" }}/]</pre
      >

      <h4>Syntax</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>
          / represents a folder separator (either on Windows (\) or Linux (/))
        </li>
        <li>
          The very first / represents the root folder (i.e the folder that we
          see when we initially enter the server)
        </li>
        <li>
          The tokens between the square braces ([ and ]) represent optional
          folders
        </li>
        <li>
          The tokens between the curly braces ({{ "{" }} and {{ "}" }})
          represent folder names
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h4>Token Guide</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>
          {{ "{" }}project{{ "}" }}: A short name for the project the audio is
          being collected for. Ideally should be similar to the project name
          user on the workbench
        </li>
        <li>
          {{ "{" }}deployment{{ "}" }}: A human readable date that roughly
          represents when the data was collected. Optionally it may include the
          deployment dates as a range.
        </li>
        <li>
          {{ "{" }}site{{ "}" }}: A short name that describes the site (the
          location on the ground) where the sensor was deployed. Ideally this
          name should be similar to site name used on the workbench
        </li>
        <li>
          {{ "{" }}memory_card{{ "}" }}: An optional folder. If the sensor used
          more than one memory card, audio should be kept in the same folders
          that represent the memory card it was recorded on.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h4>Store of other data</h4>
      <p>
        We generally encourage users to copy in any relevant data. In
        particular, leaving notes that describe the data (e.g “left mic failed”,
        or “RTC failed, dates invalid”), or copies of their records. Any
        metadata is appreciated.
      </p>
      <p>
        Most data should be put in the site folders as usually, most important
        information is related to a sensor.
      </p>

    <!-- Checking uploaded files progress bar -->
    <div *ngSwitchCase="steps.check">
      <h3>Checking Files</h3>

      <p>
        Currently our system is running an initial check of the files uploaded.
        This is to ensure the audio files are valid, and will attempt to extract
        useful metadata. Once checking is complete, you will be able to view a
        list of uploaded files, their projects, sites, points, and status
        (success, warning, error).
      </p>
      <p>
        The progress bar below shows you the current progress, and will update
        automatically without refreshing the page. You can optionally leave this
        page and come back at another time, and the site will take you to the
        most up-to-date stage of harvest (i.e if checking is complete, you will
        arrive on the Review page).

    <div *ngSwitchCase="steps.review">
      <h3>Review</h3>

      <p>
        This is a review of the audio data you have uploaded. Data is
        automatically categorized into three different states: Success, Warning,
        and Error. Success implies that the previous step was able to
        successfully extract the project, site, and point of an audio file.
        Warning indicates that some errors may have been experienced attempting
        to extract metadata from the audio file, and it may be missing project,
        site, or point information. Error means an unrecoverable issue has
        occurred and you may need to re-upload the file.
