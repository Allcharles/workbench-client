<h1>Audio Harvest Instructions</h1>
<p>
  Follow these instructions to upload audio to the site 'Site 1' in the project
  '32 Panoramic Drive, Narangba'.
</p>

<h3>1. Put audio files into one folder</h3>
<p>Your folder should now look something like the image below:</p>
<img
  src="/assets/images/harvest/audio_upload_folder.png"
  [disableAuth]="true"
/>

<h3>2. Access server</h3>
<p>Access the following host via scp:</p>
<p>
  <code>staging.ecosounds.org</code>
</p>
<h3>3. Transfer folder to server</h3>
<p>
  Transfer the entire folder to the following destination directory on the
  server:
</p>
<p><code>/data/harvester_to_do</code></p>

<h3>4. Create a harvest configuration file</h3>
<p>
  The file <strong>must</strong> be named
  <a href="/projects/1018/sites/1101/harvest.yml">harvest.yml</a>
  and <strong>must</strong> have the following format:
</p>
<pre>
# the project
project_id: 1018

# the site
site_id: 1101

# this needs to be set manually
# below is a list of uploader_ids that have write access to this project
# uncomment the one that you want to set as the uploader of the audio files
# |---------- IMPORTANT: Ensure there is no whitespaces left before uploader_id
#uploader_id: 28 # Dezmond Wells
#uploader_id: 28 # Dezmond Wells
#uploader_id: 28 # Dezmond Wells

# this is the timezone for all the recordings.
# the value should be the timezone offset that
# the recorder was set to when it started recording.
# example: `utc_offset: '+10'` for Brisbane, Australia
utc_offset: 'INTENTIONALLY_INVALID'

# structured metadata to add to each recording.
# use this to record information about sensors, etc...
metadata:
#  sensor_type: SM2
#  notes:
#    - stripped left channel due to bad mic
#    - appears to have electronic interference from solar panel
</pre>

<h3>5. Transfer harvest.yml</h3>
<p>
  It is important to do this as the last step. Once the system recognises the
  harvest.yml , it attempts to start harvesting. After the transfer, your
  audio_upload_folder should be under the following path ON THE SERVER
</p>
<p><code>/data/harvester_to_do</code></p>
<p>and look something like the image below:</p>
<img
  src="/assets/images/harvest/harvester_upload_folder.png"
  [disableAuth]="true"
/>

<h3>6. Look for logs in your audio upload folder</h3>
<p><b>process.log</b></p>
<p>A process.log file will indicate what the harvester is currently doing</p>
<p><b>error.log</b></p>
<p>
  If you find an error.log in your folder, please check it to see if the errors
  are caused by your harvest.yml file. If so, change the harvest.yml and
  transfer it over the existing one. The system recognises that the file has
  changed and will attempt to harvest the audio files in the folder again.
</p>
